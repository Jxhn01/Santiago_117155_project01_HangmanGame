## How to play
How to play? Download the repository to your computer and run the 'hangman.py'! The game comes with its own included word list. 'words.txt', which contains a list of the useful material or things used in school and university.

## Customization
You want to create or specify your own words? Just overwrite or replace the words from the 'words.txt', with each words on seperated lines. Words with spaces will also work. (Ex: ice cream). Also you can add yor massage as you like: in the line 159 adjust the message to your preference.

## Acknowledgements
- The included graphics library, `graphics.py`, was written by John Zelle for use with the book "Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science" (Franklin, Beedle & Associates). 

## Reference
This program was originally written by Tom Catullo (https://github.com/Tom25/Hangman.git) and modified by me as an reference project. I'm learning Python and I didn't have a lot time to start the project from scratch, but I did some moddifications to the project that I think it was lacking information to the user or customer to know.

## Modifications
- Replacing the list of words that the code originally came with, by simpler words and related to school and university things.
- Telling the user or customer to know how tries or attempts they have in total.
- Letting the user or customer know what the words are about.
- Fixing the happy face when you win the game.
- Adding the sad face when you lose the game.
